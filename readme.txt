A 100% handwritten follow-through of Spring's [REST service tutorial](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/), using (yet undeveloped) personal code style.

I have several reasons for doing this:
- To verify that the tutorial program does work;
- To feel how it's like actually writing a program like this - with how the IDE* looks like and feels, what error messages I encounter if I do things wrong, and how to test the program manually; and
- To better understand the bracing in the code. I think the tutorial author's bracing style is very unclear, almost Lispy.
